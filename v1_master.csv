Yarin leads the
Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning (OATML)
group. He is a
Professor of Machine Learning
at the Computer Science department, University of Oxford. He is also the
Tutorial Fellow in Computer Science
at Christ Church, Oxford, a
Turing AI Fellow
at the Turing Institute, and
Expert Advisor
to AISI, the UK Government’s AI Security Institute. He was formerly a
Research Director
for the Government’s Frontier AI Taskforce where he founded the Safeguards team.
Prior to his move to Oxford he was a Research Fellow in Computer Science at
St Catharine’s College
at the University of Cambridge. He obtained his PhD from the Cambridge
machine learning group
, working with
Prof Zoubin Ghahramani
and funded by the
Google Europe Doctoral Fellowship
.
Yarin made substantial contributions to early work in modern Bayesian deep learning—quantifying uncertainty in deep learning—and developed ML/AI tools that can inform their users when the tools are “guessing at random”. These tools have been deployed widely in industry and academia, with the tools used in medical applications, robotics, computer vision, astronomy, in the sciences, and by NASA.
Beyond his academic work, Yarin works with industry on deploying robust ML tools safely and responsibly. He co-chairs the
NASA FDL AI committee
, and is an advisor with Japanese robotics company
Preferred Networks
, as well as numerous startups.
The primary theme
guiding his research is
Pragmatic Approaches to Fundamental Research
. This includes making use of principled approaches to develop new, practical, ML tools, and studying theoretical questions uncovered by real-world applications of ML.
Fields Yarin has published work in include:
Bayesian deep learning • deep learning • adversarial machine learning • causal inference • ML and security • quantisation and pruning • active learning • continual learning • approximate Bayesian inference • Gaussian processes • Bayesian modelling • Bayesian non-parametrics • scalable MCMC • generative modelling.
With applications including:
computer vision • medical analysis • astronomy • autonomous driving • finance • natural language processing • robotics • technical AI safety • ML interpretability • reinforcement learning • and others.

Yi (Joshua) Ren is a postdoctoral researcher in the OATML Group at the University of Oxford, working under the supervision of Yarin Gal. His research takes a dynamics- and physics-inspired perspective on modern machine learning systems to understand how learning signals propagate through large neural networks and shape their representations and capabilities over time. He is particularly interested in modelling training as a dynamical system, where optimization induces forces, interactions, and constraints across different layers and features.
More broadly, his interests span large-scale representation learning, continual and lifelong learning, and the foundations of robustness and alignment in LLM-based systems. By combining theoretical analysis, physical analogies, and empirical investigation, his work seeks to build a more principled understanding of how complex learning systems evolve, and how they can be controlled more reliably in practice.
Before joining Oxford, Joshua completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Canada, working on learning dynamics.

Daniella (Zihuiwen) Ye is a DPhil alumna in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, supervised by Yarin Gal and Phil Blunsom. Her research interests lie in enhancing the reliability and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world applications, with a particular focus on text generation. She is also interested in exploring methods of controlled generation of language models, employing statistical and linguistic approaches.
Some of the topics she has researched in previous years include improving human preference learning for LLMs with synthetic critiques, a project she undertook during her internship at Cohere.

Luckeciano Carvalho Melo
PhD, started 2023

Email
Web
Luckeciano is a DPhil student in the OATML group, supervised by Yarin Gal and Alessandro Abate. His research interests lie in designing agents that learn behaviors through interactions in an efficient, generalist, safe, 
and adaptive way. He believes that such agents emerge from three main pillars: semantically rich representations of entities 
in the world; self-supervised World Models with inductive biases for memory and counterfactual reasoning; and fast policy 
adaptation mechanisms for out-of-distribution generalization.
Previously, he worked as an Applied Scientist at Microsoft, working with multi-modal representation learning and large language 
models for web data semantic understanding. He also led the RL Research group at the Center of Excellence in AI in Brazil, 
working with real-world RL applications in scalable digital platforms with industry partners.

3
4
), and deep generative models to predict the impact of genetic mutations in humans (
5
) or viral mutations likely to escape immunity (
6
).
Before Oxford, he was a Senior Manager at
McKinsey & Company
in New York and Paris, where he was leading cross-disciplinary teams on high-impact analytics projects. He holds an M.S. in Operations Research from
Columbia University
and a B.S. and M.S. in Applied Mathematics and Physics from

Panos was a DPhil student in the OATML group in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, supervised by
Yarin Gal
.From 2023 to 2025, he was a Research Scientist at Isomorphic Labs, working on AI systems for drug discovery and molecular design. He finished his PhD working on AI for science, focusing on Bayesian experimental design, causality, and machine learning systems for guiding laboratory experimentation. Before his PhD, he worked as an ML engineer at Microsoft, Autodesk Research, and Brave Research, spanning a broad spectrum of applied machine learning—from information retrieval and privacy-preserving ML to generative design tools for engineers and scientists. He is broadly interested in building AI systems that accelerate scientific progress, especially in settings where experiments are expensive, data are scarce, and causal understanding matters.

Sergio is a DPhil student in the
Random Systems CDT
at the University of Oxford, co-supervised by
Álvaro Cartea
, Yarin Gal, and
José Miguel Hernández-Lobato
(University of Cambridge). His research interests lie broadly in Probabilistic Machine Learning. In particular, he studies the connections between Gaussian Processes and Deep Learning, and explores advances in Generative Modelling (particularly LLMs, diffusion models, and flow matching). His work has two main aims: to develop theoretically grounded and efficient techniques for quantifying model uncertainty, and to design methods that accelerate training and/or inference in state-of-the-art generative models.
Before arriving in Oxford, Sergio completed the
MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence
at the University of Cambridge and earned a BSc in Theoretical Physics from QMUL. He has prior industry experience in both quantitative finance and big tech. As a Research Scientist Intern at Spotify, he worked at the intersection of Gaussian Processes and Deep Learning theory. Later, as a Quant Research Intern at a hedge fund, he developed an LLM-based systematic trading strategy. He is funded by the Man Group through the Oxford-Man Institute Scholarship.

Lukas is a PhD student at the renowned
ELLIS society
, co-supervised by
Sepp Hochreiter
at Johannes Kepler University Linz and Yarin Gal at the University of Oxford. He was a visiting PhD student in the OATML lab.
His research focuses on safety, robustness, and trustworthiness in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on improving uncertainty quantification. On the theoretical side, his work has provided new insights into
information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty
. On the applied side, Lukas has developed
QUAM
, a method for improving uncertainty estimation in classification models, as well as
SDLG
and
G-NLL

Freddie Kalaitzis
Senior Research Fellow (2020—2024)
Github
From 2020 - 2024 Freddie was a part-time
Senior Research Fellow
, and
Theme Lead
of
ML for Earth Observation and Remote Sensing
, in the
Oxford Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning
lab (led by Yarin Gal) of Oxford University. He's also an
ML & Project Lead
at
NASA's Frontier Development Lab
(FDL), and the (part-time)
ML Lead of Trillium Technologies
, the R&D production company behind FDL.
Since FDL US 2020, Freddie has been a
ML & Project Lead
for project
Waters Of The United States
(WOTUS), in partnership with the USGS, Planet, Maxar, Google Cloud and NVIDIA, towards the ultimate vision for
mapping all flowing water on Earth
, at near real-time, by fusing LiDAR sensors and daily very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery.
He started his journey with FDL 2019 as a
mentor
, helping teams
super-resolve solar magnetograms
and
predict GPS disruptions induced by solar weather
.
Until April 2020, he was an
Applied Research Scientist
in the
AI for Good
lab (led by Julien Cornebise) of
Element AI
in London, focusing on applications of ML and statistics that enable NGOs and nonprofits.
During this work, he led the
Multi-Frame
Super-Resolution research
collaboration with
Mila
Montréal
, which was awarded by ESA for topping the
PROBA-V Super-Resolution challenge
.
He also co-authored the technical report written with Amnesty International, on the
first
large-scale study of online abuse against women on Twitter
, whose front-page coverage in the Financial Times led to
Twitter working with Amnesty to better protect the rights of vulnerable users online
. Also with Amnesty, he has co-authored a technical blog-post on using VHR satellite imagery to detect evidence of genocide in rural areas of Darfur, Sudan.
Prior to Element AI, he was a Senior Data Scientist in Digital Shadows, a Data Scientist in Microsoft's Xbox EMEA team, and a
postdoc
in Bayesian statistics (with Ricardo Silva) at the
Statistical Science department
of
University College London
. He has a
PhD in Computer Science
from the
University of Sheffield
(supervised by Neil Lawrence), and a
MSc in Artificial Intelligence
from the
University of Edinburgh
. His PhD research led to contributions in probability methods for dimensionality reduction of data and developed methods for gene-expression time-series to discover genetic factors of disease.
Off work, he occasionally mentors teenagers of ages 12-18 for Teens in AI, and he is the
founder
of
Well-Being in ML
, the first official social event at NeurIPS advocating for
healthy well-being and mental practice in academia and industry of ML
.

Angus was jointly supervised by Alison Noble and Yarin Gal within the EPSRC CDT in Health Data Science. He works on the application, characterisation and improvement of interpretable machine learning in healthcare, specifically ultrasound imaging. He grew up in Oxford so is one of the few who have had the fortune of seeing the city from both a town and gown perspective. He received an MSci degree from Durham in Natural Sciences, specialising in computational chemistry and quantum mechanics in his final year. After his degree, he ignited his interest in the application of machine learning to medical problems while working at Optellum, an Oxford based startup focused on the early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Andrew was a Ph.D. student in the
Department of Computer Science
at the University of Oxford. He works in the
Applied and Theoretical Machine Learning Group
(OATML) under the supervision of Yarin Gal. Before joining the group, he was a program manager and researcher at
Imagia
in Montreal. He obtained his undergraduate and master’s degrees from the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
at McGill University, working in the
Probabilistic Vision Group
(PVG) under the supervision of Tal Arbel. His research focuses on personalized decision-making under uncertainty in causal-effect estimates. Specifically, he is interested in quantifying, integrating, and reducing the uncertainty that arises from the relaxation of causal assumptions.

Sören was a DPhil student in CS supervised by
Yarin Gal
from
OATML
and
Allan Dafoe
from Oxford’s
Centre for the Governance of AI
. His interests in machine learning include its economic and political properties, how it scales, and safety. Before joining OATML, he worked on reward inference and machine learning for game theory with David Duvenaud and Roger Grosse at Toronto’s Vector Institute, with the Center for Human-compatible AI at UC Berkeley, and at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford. He has degrees in machine learning (UCL), maths (Amsterdam) and Future Planet Studies (Amsterdam). Sören is co-funded by Oxford and DeepMind.

Lars Holdijk
MSc by Research (2021—2022)
Github
Email
Web
My name is Lars Holdijk, master student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam. I am currently an ELLIS honours student supervised by Prof. Max Welling at the University of Amsterdam and Prof. Yarin Gal at the University of Oxford. My recent interest include a wide range of topics in machine learning such as probabilistic modelling, interpretability and robustness. Have a look at my publication list to get a quick overview.
I obtained my bachelors degree in computer science from the Rijksuniversiteit in Groningen in 2018. In between my bachelor and masters, I spend some time as a student researcher at Porsche in Weissach, Germany. After finalizing my masters degree I hope to join a PhD. program.

Challenger Mishra
Postdoc (2018—2020)
Github
Web
Challenger is a theoretical physicist working on the long-standing problem of quantising gravity. 
Recently, he started to undertake work in Theoretical Machine Learning, in order to exploit its tools to understand String Theory as a problem in big data.
As a
Rhodes Scholar
he has pursued his passion in understanding fundamental physical processes by undertaking doctoral work in String Theory at the Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford. During his recently completed thesis, he worked on understanding various aspects of complex geometries that feature in String Theory, using the tools of differential and algebraic-geometry. 
Prior to this, Challenger completed his undergraduate work in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata. During his undergraduate years, he worked on a NASA-sponsored project applying stochastic optimisation techniques to analyse data from the proposed gravitaional wave detector, LISA. 
When he isn’t tied up in stringy or machine learning affairs, he likes to show off his constantly diminishing skills in table tennis.
After OATML, Challenger was appointed as an Accelerate Science Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge.
